# Pretend that you have just opened a new savings account 
# that earns 4 percent interest per year. 
# The interest that you earn is paid at the end of the year, 
# and is added to the balance of the savings account. 
# Write a program that begins by reading the amount 
# of money deposited into the account from the user. 
# Then your program should compute and display the amount 
# in the savings account after 1, 2, and 3 years. Display
# each amount so that it is rounded to 2 decimal places.
