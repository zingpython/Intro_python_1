# Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should
# compute and display:
# • Thesumofaandb
# • The difference when b is subtracted from a • The product of a and b
#   Exercise 8: Widgets and Gizmos 6 1 Introduction to Programming Exercises
# • The quotient when a is divided by b
# • The remainder when a is divided by b
# • The result of log10 a
# • The result of ab
# Hint: You will probably find the log10 
# function in the math module helpful 
# for computing the second last item in the list.

from math import log10
